Our goals are to popularize Rust in Ukraine, develop the community around it, launch and support such Ukrainian mentoring and educational programs, and attract Rust projects and related investments in Ukraine.

## Why Rust?
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety. It is an effective tool for the collaboration of large developer teams with different levels of knowledge. Furthermore, according to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Rust is the most beloved programming language several times in a row. The Rust community is traditionally very friendly.

These are the core values of our organization:
- **mutual assistance**
- **openness to** listen to alternative points of view
- cultivation of **Open Source** culture
- fostering a **friendly attitude** towards each other

Yes, but please keep your description concise and move the conversation to private after finding a candidate.
